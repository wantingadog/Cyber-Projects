There was only one picture on the twitter profile page.
The photo was downloaded in a sandbox environment. 
The commamds 'file' and 'strings' were used on the photo to determine if there is any file or message hidden.
Nothing useful was found using these commands.

There was a webpage link attached to the profile page.
Ran theHarvester command with the link and nothing was found.
The link went through several links and led to an online shopping webpage.

The photo link was then run through tinyeye and lots of results were shown. 
Websites that was made after the twitter posts are not related.
Websites that are reputable seem not related too.
